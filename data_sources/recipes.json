        "Butter an 11\" x 7\" baking dish and line with parchment paper. Butter the bottom and sides of the parchment and dust generously with confectioner's sugar to cover all of the buttered area. In the bowl of a stand mixer, sprinkle the gelatin over the water. Allow to sit while you prepare the syrup so the gelatin blooms. In a small saucepan fitted with a candy thermometer and set over medium heat, combine boiling water, sugar, and salt.",
        "Whisk frequently until the mixture begins to boil. Once boiling, stop whisking and allow to boil until the candy thermometer reads 236 F***.",
        "Remove the syrup from the heat and slowly pour into the mixer over the bloomed gelatin.",
        "Add the peppermint extract.Beat the ingredients together at medium speed for about 20 minutes, until the mixture is thick and white like marshmallow creme and has expanded substantially. Once it starts to look sticky, particularly around the sides of the mixer bowl, it should be done. Butter a spatula (and offset one works well) and pour the marshmallow mixture into the prepared dish. Smooth the top with the back of the spatula, starting at one corner and moving up, down, and across the dish in a swirling motion until you reach the opposite corner.",
        "Add about 15 drops of red food coloring, scattered randomly over the top of the marshmallows. Swirl the color around with a toothpick.",
        "Place the marshmallows in the freezer, uncovered, overnight. Lay out a large piece of parchment paper to use while dipping the marshmallows in chocolate.",
        "Remove the marshmallows from the freezer and lift out of the dish using the sides of the parchment. Carefully peel the parchment down from the sides of the marshmallows. Butter a pair of kitchen shears and cut the marshmallows into strips, and each strip into cubes (sized like jumbo marshmallows). Set cut marshmallows on the clean parchment, swirled-side up. Bring a pot of water to a simmer on the stove over medium-low heat.",
        "Place the chocolate in a bowl over the simmering water and allow to melt, stirring frequently once it begins to melt until it's smooth. For the marshmallow pops, stick the tip of a cake pop stick into the melted chocolate, covering about 3/4\" with chocolate. Stick the chocolate-covered end into the center of a marshmallow on the swirled-side. Leave on the parchment, stick-up, while you repeat with the remaining marshmallows. Once finished, coat each marshmallow with chocolate by using a spatula with a flat tip to push some chocolate up each side. Use the spatula to spoon chocolate onto the bottom of the marshmallow as well (the side opposite the pop stick). Sprinkle peppermint candy pieces over the chocolate, if desired, and then return the marshmallow pop to the parchment, again stick-side up, to allow the chocolate to set. Repeat with remaining marshmallows. To make chocolate-covered marshmallows without the pop sticks, simply dip the bottom and sides of each marshmallow into the chocolate, leaving the swirled-side exposed, and return to the parchment, swirl-side up, to set. Once the chocolate has set on all of the marshmallows, place them in an airtight container. Marshmallows can be stored at room temperature, but if you don't plan to finish them within a few days, keep them in the freezer so they stay softer. Marshmallows with peppermint candy coating look best the day they are made."

Season with pepper and additional salt as necessary.Cassie's Notes:A couple of readers have written back to say that their yogurt curdled when adding it to the soup.  I have updated the recipe to instruct to use room temperature yogurt, and to remove the soup from the heat for a few minutes before adding the yogurt.  If you are worried about the yogurt curdling, you could add a ladle-full of slightly cooled soup to the yogurt and stir well, and then add back into the soup.  By doing this, you are \"tempering\" the yogurt in hopes that it will incorporate without curdling.  Especially take this step if you use non-fat yogurt.  Sour cream can also be subbed for the Greek yogurt."

        "Here's a great tasting, quick and easy chicken dish; perfect for busy weeknights and great for those on a budget! I made this in about 20 minutes or less and served this over some brown rice cooked in chicken broth. I would have taken a photo of my dish, but we were all so eager to eat this while it was hot, that there was nothing left to photograph.This recipe was lightened up from Julia's Healthy Italian. She has twice as many family members in her household so I halved her recipe and cut back on the butter and olive oil. I then substituted half of the wine for fat free chicken broth and the results were fantastic. Can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch!If you prefer to use chicken breasts, slice them into large strips before you cook them. Be careful not to overcook your chicken, there's nothing worse than tough chicken. I gave you an estimated cooking time, but use your judgment as the time can differ depending on the size of the chicken. To make this gluten free, you ocan skip the flour, or use rice flour instead. Those of you who don't cook with wine, use chicken broth instead. For a side dish, may I suggest",

You're more than welcome to blend the entire mixture to be more of a puree consistency. If you're worried about blending too much, you can always ladle out a few scoopfuls of beans, blend the soup, then add the beans back in. Really, it's all up to preference! :)",

Toss cauliflower with 1 \u00be tsp kosher salt and allow to sit for about 30 minutes, then rinse. This will draw out excess moisture from inside the cauliflower, allowing it to absorb the pickling brine and spices better.Evenly distribute the cardamom pods, bay leaves, curry powder, crushed red pepper and turmeric between the pint jars (1/3 of the ingredient amount listed in each jar).Distribute the cauliflower between the jars and press down with tongs to make sure everything is tightly packed. The brine should be room temperature by now- if it isn't, wait till it cools off before proceeding. Using a wide mouth funnel, cover the cauliflower with the brine, leaving about \u00bd inch of headspace in each jar. Clean the rims of the jars with a damp paper towel or clean kitchen towel. At this point, to make refrigerator pickles, you can put lids on the jars, shake them to disperse the spices, and place directly into the refrigerator. They will be ready to eat in 1 week (you can taste them after 2-3 days, but flavor will be best after a full week). The pickles should last for about 4 weeks. Always check and smell for spoilage before eating to be safe.If you prefer to can the cauliflower for longer shelf life, place the lids on the jars and seal with the bands using just your fingertips so that they are secure but not too tight. Process for 10 minutes using the boiling water method - click here for details.As soon as the timer goes off, quickly and carefully remove the jars using the jar lifter.",
        "Place them on the clean towels and allow to cool for 24 hours. After 24 hours you can remove the bands and test your seals by lifting the jar, by the lid, a few inches from the counter top. Jars with good seals can be kept in a cool dark place for up to a year. If the seal is broken, store in the refrigerator and use within 2 weeks. Canned pickles will be ready to eat 2-3 days after canning them."

Use a rolling pin to roll over the surface of the tart pan to cleanly cut off the excess dough from the edges.  Freeze for at least half an hour before blind-baking.1b Pre-bake the frozen crust (also called \"blind\" baking).  Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Line the frozen crust with heavy duty aluminum foil or with parchment paper.  Allow for a couple inches to extend beyond the sides of the tart or pie pan.  Fill two-thirds with dry beans or other pie weights (I've heard copper pennies work well for this too).  If you are using a pan with a removable bottom, place the pan on a rimmed baking sheet in the oven to catch any spillage.",
        "Bake for 20 minutes. Then remove from oven, remove the pie weights (the easiest way to do this is to lift up the foil by the edges) and the foil.  Using the tines of a fork, poke little holes all around the base of the crust.  Return to the oven and bake for another 10 minutes, until lightly browned all over.",
        "Remove from oven and set aside.2 Cook the bacon.",
        "Heat a large frying pan on medium heat.  Arrange strips of bacon in a single layer on the bottom of the pan (you may need to work in batches or do two pans at once). Slowly cook the bacon, turning the strips over occasionally until they are nicely browned and much of the fat has rendered out.  Lay the cooked strips of bacon on a paper towel to absorb the excess fat.",
        "Pour fat out of the pan into a jar (not down the drain, unless you want to clog the pipes) for future use, or wait until it solidifies and discard in the trash.  Chop the cooked bacon crosswise into 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch pieces.3 Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F.",
        "Whisk the eggs in a large bowl.",

        "Whisk the egg-milk mixture hard again for a few seconds, then pour it gently into the pie crust. You want the bacon and cheese to be suspended in the mix, so you might need to gently stir it around just a little. You also want the chives, which will float, to be evenly arranged on top, so move them around with a spoon until you like where they are. 4",
        "Put the quiche into the preheated oven and bake for 30-40 minutes. (If using pan with removable bottom, be sure to place a rimmed baking sheet underneath.) Check for doneness after 30 minutes by gently jiggling the quiche. It should still have just a little wiggle. (It will finish setting while it cools.) Cool on a wire rack.Eat at room temperature, cold (a quiche will keep for several days in the fridge), or reheated gently in a 200-degree oven."

        "Brine the pork chops (optional step but recommended): In a saucepan large enough to accommodate the chops, add the first 2 cups water, cinnamon stick, thyme, star anise, salt and coriander seeds. Bring this to a boil on the stove just to dissolve the salt and coax out the flavor of the spices. Set aside for a few minutes to let the flavors infuse the liquid then add the remaining two cups water. Make sure that the liquid is at room temperature or tepid before adding the chops. Leave the meat in the brine, refrigerated, for a minimum of 1 hour up to 24 hours.To prepare the Pork Chops: Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F. Take them out of the brine and pat dry. It would be better if they were close to room temperature before you cook them. Season with a bit of salt and pepper on both sides.",
        "Heat about 2 tablespoons of oil in a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot,",
        "Add the pork chops to the pan and sear the first side for 3 minutes or until the meat is nicely brown. You can then flip the meat over and transfer to the oven to finish cooking but if you're also preparing the fregola pasta, transfer the meat to a foil-lined baking sheet instead so you can use the skillet for the pasta. The meat may take 4-6 minutes depending on the thickness of the chops. While the meat is in the oven, prepare the fregola pasta.To prepare the Fregola Sarda: Using the same skillet that the pork chops seared in and keeping the heat at medium or medium-high, add a splash or two of wine to deglaze. Scrape the bottom of the skillet to loosen the flavor from the meat. You can add a bit more oil but if there's enough to loosen the starchy pasta you can skip this step. I added about 1 more tablespoon before adding the fregola pasta to the skillet. Stir fry the pasta in the oil for a minute or two, just until the pasta begins to separate again (the starch develops when you drain it after cooking so some may stick together but the oil loosens them up again).",
        "Add a couple splashes of chicken stock and just to loosen the pasta a bit more and sprinkle a little fresh lemon juice. If you feel it needs salt, add just a little.",
        "Transfer the stir-fried fregola sarda to a bowl and toss in the persimmon and mint. Taste again--I added a bit more lemon juice and drizzled a bit more olive oil but this just my preference. Set aside.To prepare the dandelions greens: Stir fry in the same skillet you cooked the pork chops and the pasta in or use a different pan.",
        "Heat a tablespoon or two of oil, add the sliced garlic and when the garlic is fragrant, about 10-20 seconds, add the dandelion greens. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the greens have wilted down. Season with a bit of salt and add a bit of lemon juice for flavor.Arrange the pork chop, pasta and greens on a plate and serve."

Here is my first change to the recipe. I doubled the recipe since there is seven of us, and so I added a bit more butter than it called for (even doubled) to make sure that every noodle had some butter. Total I think I used about 3-4 Tbs.Next, in a separate bowl, mix the egg, the evaporated milk, the dry mustard and the red pepper. It need to be mixed a lot better than this photo, which is way too lumpy and not blended yet.When you have finished mixing it all, pour the entire bowl over the pasta. Stir until it begins to thicken, about three to five minutes.",
        "Remove the pan from the heat then add the cheese in four installments, making sure the first is melted completely before adding the next. Believe it or not, this actually helps with the creaminess. I did wind up adding a splash of milk at the end to get just a little more creaminess at the end. You can do this or you can skip it.",
